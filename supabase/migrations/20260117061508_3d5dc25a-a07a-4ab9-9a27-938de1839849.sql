-- Zero-Waste Design entries
('Zero-Waste Pattern Cutting', 'zero-waste-pattern-cutting', 'Zero-waste pattern cutting is a design methodology that eliminates textile waste at the pattern-making stage. By treating the fabric width as a fixed parameter, designers create interlocking pattern pieces that use 100% of the material.

This approach requires a fundamental shift in design thinking—garment silhouettes emerge from geometric constraints rather than being imposed upon fabric. The resulting designs often feature unexpected proportions and construction details that become signature elements.

Pioneered by designers like Timo Rissanen and Holly McQuillan, zero-waste cutting has evolved from an academic exercise into a commercially viable practice adopted by brands seeking to address the 15% average fabric waste in conventional garment production.', 'published'),

('Marker Optimization Techniques', 'marker-optimization-techniques', 'Marker optimization refers to the strategic arrangement of pattern pieces on fabric to minimize waste. While traditional markers accept 10-20% waste as inevitable, advanced optimization techniques can reduce this to under 5%.

Modern approaches combine algorithmic software with designer intuition. Nested cutting layouts, jigsaw-style arrangements, and modular pattern systems allow manufacturers to extract maximum value from each meter of fabric.

The environmental impact is significant: optimizing markers across the global apparel industry could save millions of tons of textile waste annually while reducing raw material costs for producers.', 'published'),

('Jigsaw Pattern Systems', 'jigsaw-pattern-systems', 'Jigsaw pattern systems treat garment construction as a puzzle where every piece must fit together without gaps. Unlike conventional patternmaking where shapes are designed independently, jigsaw systems consider the negative space between pieces as a design constraint.

These systems often produce unconventional garment constructions—seam placements determined by efficiency rather than convention, and finishing details that celebrate rather than hide the zero-waste methodology.

The learning curve is steep, but designers who master jigsaw systems often find their creativity enhanced rather than constrained by the geometric requirements.', 'published'),

-- Garment Refashioning entries
('Garment-to-Garment Reconstruction', 'garment-to-garment-reconstruction', 'Garment-to-garment reconstruction transforms existing clothing into entirely new pieces without reducing materials to fiber or fabric level. This direct transformation preserves the embedded energy of original manufacturing while creating unique, often one-of-a-kind pieces.

The practice ranges from simple alterations—taking in seams, shortening hems—to radical deconstruction and reassembly. Advanced practitioners combine multiple source garments into single new pieces, creating hybrid designs impossible to achieve through conventional manufacturing.

This approach represents the highest-value form of textile recycling, maintaining material integrity while adding creative and economic value through skilled labor.', 'published'),

('Deconstructive Tailoring', 'deconstructive-tailoring', 'Deconstructive tailoring applies traditional tailoring skills to the dismantling and reimagining of existing garments. Practitioners analyze construction methods, identify valuable components, and reassemble them according to new design specifications.

The discipline requires deep understanding of garment construction—seam allowances, fabric behavior, and structural elements like interfacing and linings. Master deconstructivists can transform a men''s suit into a women''s jacket, or combine multiple blouses into a single dress.

This skill set bridges traditional craftsmanship with contemporary sustainability concerns, creating a new category of maker who is equally historian and innovator.', 'published'),

('Silhouette Transformation Methods', 'silhouette-transformation-methods', 'Silhouette transformation encompasses techniques for radically altering a garment''s shape and proportions while maintaining material integrity. From boxy to fitted, oversized to structured—these methods extend the useful life of clothing that might otherwise be discarded due to style obsolescence.

Key techniques include strategic seam relocation, dart manipulation, and panel insertion or removal. Advanced practitioners can transform decade-old silhouettes into contemporary shapes, making vintage pieces wearable for modern contexts.

The practice challenges fast fashion''s obsolescence model by demonstrating that style currency can be renewed through skill rather than consumption.', 'published'),

-- Textile Waste Upcycling entries
('Post-Consumer Textile Recycling', 'post-consumer-textile-recycling', 'Post-consumer textile recycling addresses the 85% of clothing that currently ends up in landfills. Unlike donation or resale, recycling transforms materials into new products, often through mechanical or chemical processes that break down fibers for reuse.

The challenge lies in mixed-fiber content and contamination. Pure cotton or wool can be shredded and respun, but polyester-cotton blends require chemical separation. Innovation in this space focuses on scalable solutions for fiber identification and separation.

Emerging technologies promise closed-loop systems where old garments become feedstock for new fabric production, though commercial viability remains limited to specific fiber types.', 'published'),

('Pre-Consumer Waste Streams', 'pre-consumer-waste-streams', 'Pre-consumer textile waste includes cutting scraps, sampling materials, and production overruns—waste generated before products reach consumers. This cleaner, more consistent waste stream offers significant upcycling opportunities.

Factory scraps maintain known fiber content and quality specifications, making them easier to process than post-consumer waste. Progressive manufacturers now view cutting waste as a secondary product rather than disposal cost.

Small-scale upcyclers often partner with manufacturers to access this premium waste stream, creating products from materials that would otherwise be landfilled or downcycled into industrial rags.', 'published'),

('Industrial Offcut Utilization', 'industrial-offcut-utilization', 'Industrial offcuts—the irregular fabric pieces remaining after pattern cutting—represent an underexploited resource for creative upcycling. These scraps maintain full fabric quality but are too small or irregularly shaped for conventional manufacturing.

Designers working with offcuts develop specialized skills in small-piece assembly, patchwork construction, and modular design systems. The constraints often produce distinctive aesthetics that become brand signatures.

Some operations specialize entirely in offcut sourcing, building businesses around materials that cost nothing at origin but gain value through creative transformation.', 'published'),

-- Denim Upcycling entries
('Denim Deconstruction Practices', 'denim-deconstruction-practices', 'Denim''s durability and cultural significance make it ideal for deconstruction and reconstruction. The fabric''s strength allows repeated sewing and handling, while its familiar aesthetic carries meaning across cultures and generations.

Practitioners harvest components based on wear patterns and indigo fading—each piece tells a story through its patina. Pockets, waistbands, and leg panels become building blocks for new designs that celebrate denim''s heritage.

The practice connects to denim''s working-class origins while elevating discarded jeans into considered design objects.', 'published'),

('Indigo Preservation Techniques', 'indigo-preservation-techniques', 'Indigo''s unique dyeing process—building color through repeated oxidation—creates unrepeatable fade patterns on denim. Preserving and showcasing these patterns is central to high-quality denim upcycling.

Skilled practitioners identify "sweet spots" of wear: whiskers, honeycombs, and pocket fading that indicate authentic use. These areas become focal points in new designs, turning wear marks into features rather than flaws.

Advanced techniques include strategic washing to enhance existing fades and careful pressing to maintain dimensional characteristics of original wear patterns.', 'published'),

('Jean Jacket Hybridization', 'jean-jacket-hybridization', 'The jean jacket occupies unique territory in fashion—simultaneously workwear, subcultural signifier, and wardrobe staple. Hybridizing jean jackets combines this cultural weight with creative transformation.

Common approaches include sleeve substitution (adding knit or contrast fabric sleeves), panel replacement (leather accents, quilted sections), and silhouette modification (cropping, extending, or reshaping).

The results maintain the jacket''s iconic status while adding personal expression or elevated design details that distinguish from mass-market versions.', 'published'),

-- Deadstock Utilization entries
('Deadstock Fabric Sourcing', 'deadstock-fabric-sourcing', 'Deadstock fabric—unused materials from cancelled orders, overproduction, or brand closures—offers access to high-quality textiles at reduced environmental cost. No new resources are consumed in production; the materials already exist.

Sourcing requires industry connections and opportunistic buying. Quantities are unpredictable, requiring flexible design approaches that adapt to available materials rather than specifying fabrics in advance.

Successful deadstock brands build identities around material resourcefulness, marketing limited-edition pieces made from fabrics that will never be available again.', 'published'),

('End-of-Roll Design Strategies', 'end-of-roll-design-strategies', 'End-of-roll fabric—the final meters remaining after production runs—presents unique design challenges. Quantities are limited and inconsistent, requiring modular or small-batch approaches.

Designers working with end-of-roll stock develop systems for mixing short lengths into cohesive collections. Color blocking, strategic paneling, and intentional mismatch become aesthetic features rather than limitations.

This approach suits made-to-order or limited-run business models where flexibility and uniqueness are valued over consistency.', 'published'),

('Vintage Fabric Restoration', 'vintage-fabric-restoration', 'Vintage fabrics—stored for decades—often require restoration before use. Proper cleaning, pressing, and sometimes structural repair bring dormant materials back to working condition.

The rewards justify the effort: vintage textiles offer weave structures, fiber qualities, and print designs unavailable in contemporary production. Liberty prints from the 1960s, Japanese cottons from defunct mills, Italian wools from closed houses—these materials connect new garments to textile history.

Restoration skills include stain removal, fiber identification, and construction techniques appropriate to fragile or aged materials.', 'published'),

-- Repair & Visible Mending entries
('Visible Mending Philosophy', 'visible-mending-philosophy', 'Visible mending rejects the repair paradigm of invisible restoration. Instead of hiding damage, visible mending celebrates it—using contrasting thread, decorative patches, and obvious stitching to mark the garment''s history.

Rooted in Japanese concepts like wabi-sabi and kintsugi, visible mending finds beauty in imperfection and evidence of use. Each repair becomes a design element, accumulating over time into a unique garment biography.

The practice carries political weight in consumer culture: choosing repair over replacement, and making that choice visible, constitutes a quiet rejection of disposability.', 'published'),

('Sashiko and Boro Techniques', 'sashiko-boro-techniques', 'Sashiko and boro represent centuries-old Japanese textile practices now finding global adoption. Sashiko—running stitch patterns creating geometric designs—reinforces fabric while adding decoration. Boro—the layered patching of worn textiles—extends material life through accumulation.

These techniques developed from necessity in rural Japan, where textiles were precious and imported cotton was rare. Today they offer meditative, low-tech approaches to garment extension that require minimal tools and maximum patience.

Contemporary practitioners adapt traditional patterns to modern garments, creating visual continuity with historical textile cultures while addressing current sustainability concerns.', 'published'),

('Darning as Design Practice', 'darning-as-design-practice', 'Darning—the interlacing of thread to replace worn fabric—is among the oldest textile repair techniques. Contemporary darning practitioners elevate this utilitarian skill into deliberate design practice.

Using contrasting yarns, experimental weave patterns, and strategic placement, designers transform holes and worn spots into focal points. The darn becomes a signature element, drawing attention rather than deflecting it.

This inversion—flaw as feature—challenges assumptions about garment condition and value, suggesting that wear and repair might enhance rather than diminish worth.', 'published'),

-- Secondhand Transformation entries
('Thrift Flip Methodology', 'thrift-flip-methodology', 'Thrift flipping transforms secondhand garments through alteration, combination, and creative intervention. The practice democratizes upcycling, requiring minimal investment and basic sewing skills.

Successful thrift flipping requires trained eye—the ability to see potential in unlikely source garments. An oversized dress becomes a structured top; men''s trousers transform into a skirt; multiple blouses combine into a single patchwork piece.

Social media has amplified the practice, with creators documenting transformations and sharing techniques with global audiences.', 'published'),

('Size Adaptation Techniques', 'size-adaptation-techniques', 'Size adaptation addresses one of secondhand shopping''s primary barriers: the limited size range of vintage and thrifted clothing. Skilled adaptation expands or contracts garments to fit new bodies.

Techniques range from simple—letting out seams, adding gussets—to complex restructuring that maintains garment integrity while significantly altering dimensions. The goal is invisible modification: the finished piece should appear intentionally designed at its new size.

This skill set enables access to vintage treasures previously limited to narrow size ranges, democratizing secondhand fashion beyond bodies that happen to match historical sizing norms.', 'published'),

-- Patchwork & Quilting entries
('Contemporary Patchwork Construction', 'contemporary-patchwork-construction', 'Contemporary patchwork applies traditional quilting techniques to garment construction. Rather than decorative bed covers, modern practitioners create wearable pieces from assembled fragments.

The approach suits sustainability goals: small fabric pieces unusable for conventional cutting become building blocks for complex designs. The constraints of patchwork—working with available materials rather than designed patterns—often produce unexpected aesthetic outcomes.

Technical challenges include matching fabric weights, managing bulk at seam intersections, and creating stable structures from potentially unstable components.', 'published'),

('Improvisational Quilting Methods', 'improvisational-quilting-methods', 'Improvisational quilting rejects templates and planned layouts in favor of intuitive composition. Practitioners work responsively, letting each added piece inform the next decision.

This approach suits upcycling contexts where source materials arrive unpredictably. Rather than waiting for matching fabrics, improvisational quilters incorporate whatever becomes available, trusting process to create coherence.

The results often carry more energy and visual interest than planned quilts, reflecting the responsive decision-making embedded in their construction.', 'published'),

-- Dyeing & Surface Treatment entries
('Natural Dye Applications', 'natural-dye-applications', 'Natural dyeing uses plant, mineral, and insect-derived colorants instead of synthetic dyes. Applied to upcycling, natural dyes can transform stained or faded textiles into newly vibrant pieces.

The process requires patience—mordanting, repeated dipping, and proper fixation—but produces colors with depth and complexity impossible to achieve synthetically. Indigo''s living oxidation, madder''s warm variations, and weld''s bright yellows each carry distinct characteristics.

Natural dyeing connects contemporary practice to pre-industrial textile traditions while addressing concerns about synthetic dye pollution in global waterways.', 'published'),

('Overdyeing and Color Revival', 'overdyeing-color-revival', 'Overdyeing applies new color over existing dyed fabric, creating complex color relationships impossible to achieve through single dyeing. Faded garments gain new life; stains disappear under deeper hues.

The technique requires understanding of color interaction—red over blue creates purple; yellow over faded black produces olive. Practitioners develop intuition for predicting outcomes from starting color, fabric fiber, and dye choice.

Overdyeing offers low-cost color transformation without complex equipment, making it accessible to home practitioners and small studios alike.', 'published'),

-- Embellishment & Handcraft entries
('Embroidered Repair and Embellishment', 'embroidered-repair-embellishment', 'Embroidery bridges repair and embellishment—functional stitching that simultaneously decorates. A patch becomes a canvas; a reinforced seam becomes a design line; stain coverage becomes botanical illustration.

The practice requires needle skills but minimal equipment, making it accessible across economic contexts. Historical embroidery traditions from every culture offer technique vocabularies applicable to contemporary upcycling.

Time investment is significant—hours of handwork for visible results—but the meditative quality of stitching often provides value beyond the finished product.', 'published'),

('Beading and Surface Adornment', 'beading-surface-adornment', 'Beading adds material value to garments through accumulated handwork. Applied to upcycled pieces, beading can elevate simple source garments into statement pieces worthy of special occasions.

Techniques range from scattered individual beads to dense beaded panels requiring thousands of hand-sewn elements. Weight and care requirements must be considered—heavily beaded pieces require hand washing and careful storage.

Sourcing reclaimed beads from vintage jewelry, broken necklaces, or thrifted decorative items extends the upcycling philosophy to embellishment materials themselves.', 'published'),

-- Circular Fashion Systems entries
('Closed-Loop Production Models', 'closed-loop-production-models', 'Closed-loop production systems design for end-of-life from the beginning. Garments are constructed for eventual disassembly; materials are selected for recyclability; take-back programs ensure products return to manufacturers rather than landfills.

Implementation requires systemic thinking beyond individual garments. Fiber choices, joining methods, and business models must align. Mono-material construction simplifies recycling; mechanical fasteners enable non-destructive disassembly.

Few brands achieve true closed-loop status, but the concept provides direction for industry transformation beyond incremental sustainability improvements.', 'published'),

('Take-Back Program Design', 'take-back-program-design', 'Take-back programs collect used garments from consumers for recycling, refurbishment, or responsible disposal. Effective programs require convenient collection, transparent processing, and genuine material recovery rather than greenwashing.

Design considerations include incentive structures (discounts, loyalty points), collection logistics (in-store, mail-back, pickup), and processing partnerships (recyclers, upcyclers, resale platforms).

The most successful programs integrate take-back into brand identity, making return as natural as purchase and building ongoing relationships with consumers beyond initial transactions.', 'published'),

-- Mixed-Material / Bricolage entries
('Mixed-Media Garment Construction', 'mixed-media-garment-construction', 'Mixed-media construction combines disparate materials—textile with leather, fabric with metal, woven with knit—into unified garments. The approach suits upcycling contexts where material availability is unpredictable.

Technical challenges include joining dissimilar materials, managing different care requirements, and creating visual coherence from potentially chaotic combinations.

The best mixed-media work transcends its salvage origins, appearing as intentional design rather than constrained assemblage.', 'published'),

('Found Object Integration', 'found-object-integration', 'Found object integration extends upcycling beyond textiles to include non-fabric materials. Hardware, jewelry fragments, industrial components, and natural objects become garment elements.

Safety and wearability require careful consideration—sharp edges must be covered or removed; weight distribution must be manageable; cleaning must remain possible.

The results often carry surrealist or sculptural qualities, blurring boundaries between garment and art object.', 'published'),

-- Leather & Non-Textile entries
('Leather Reconditioning Methods', 'leather-reconditioning-methods', 'Leather''s durability enables reconditioning that extends material life for decades. Cleaning, conditioning, and minor repairs restore vintage leather to functional condition while preserving patina and character.

Techniques include saddle soap cleaning, oil conditioning, scratch repair, and hardware replacement. More significant damage—tears, holes, extensive wear—may require patching or panel replacement.

Reconditioning skills apply across leather goods: jackets, bags, shoes, and accessories all benefit from proper maintenance and restoration.', 'published'),

('Leather Patchwork Applications', 'leather-patchwork-applications', 'Leather patchwork assembles small pieces into larger panels suitable for garment construction. Scraps from bag production, damaged sections from vintage pieces, and sample materials combine into unique composite surfaces.

Joining requires specialized equipment—industrial machines or hand-stitching with appropriate needles and thread. Edge finishing techniques prevent fraying and create clean seam allowances.

The resulting material carries visual complexity impossible to achieve with single hides, with color and texture variations adding depth.', 'published'),

-- Community-Based / DIY entries
('Repair Café Facilitation', 'repair-cafe-facilitation', 'Repair cafés create community spaces where experienced menders help others repair clothing and household textiles. The model spreads skills while extending product lifespans and building social connections.

Successful facilitation requires space, basic equipment (sewing machines, irons, notions), volunteer expertise, and community outreach. Regular scheduling builds habit and expectation.

Beyond individual repairs, cafés shift cultural attitudes toward maintenance and care, normalizing repair as routine practice rather than exceptional intervention.', 'published'),

('Skill-Sharing Workshop Models', 'skill-sharing-workshop-models', 'Skill-sharing workshops teach specific techniques in focused sessions. Unlike ongoing classes, workshops deliver concentrated learning that participants can immediately apply.

Effective workshop design includes clear learning objectives, appropriate difficulty levels, take-home resources, and hands-on practice time. Demonstrations must be visible; materials must be adequate; pacing must accommodate varied skill levels.

Workshops often serve as entry points—participants gain enough skill to attempt projects independently, potentially returning for advanced sessions.', 'published'),

-- Natural Fiber Reuse entries
('Wool Fiber Recovery', 'wool-fiber-recovery', 'Wool''s natural properties—resilience, felting capacity, biodegradability—make it ideal for fiber-level recovery. Old sweaters can be unraveled for yarn; felted wool can be cut for craft applications; worn wool returns nutrients to soil.

Unraveling requires patience and technique—proper unwinding preserves fiber integrity; rushed pulling creates breakage. The reclaimed yarn often carries more character than virgin equivalents.

For items beyond unraveling, wool''s ability to felt opens additional possibilities: fulled fabric becomes stable material for cutting without fraying.', 'published'),

('Linen and Hemp Restoration', 'linen-hemp-restoration', 'Linen and hemp textiles improve with age—fibers soften through washing and wear while maintaining strength. Vintage linens offer quality often unavailable in contemporary production.

Restoration addresses stains, tears, and storage damage. Enzyme treatments can remove aged stains; reweaving repairs holes; proper pressing restores hand and drape.

These bast fibers connect to pre-industrial textile traditions when linen and hemp were common rather than luxury materials.', 'published'),

-- Recycled Synthetic Materials entries
('Polyester Recycling Processes', 'polyester-recycling-processes', 'Polyester recycling addresses the permanence problem: synthetic fibers persist for centuries in landfills. Mechanical recycling shreds and melts polyester for respinning; chemical recycling breaks polymers to molecular level for reconstitution.

Current limitations include color contamination (recycled polyester tends toward gray), fiber quality degradation through mechanical processing, and the energy intensity of chemical approaches.

Despite limitations, recycled polyester represents significant improvement over virgin production, reducing petroleum dependence and landfill burden.', 'published'),

('Nylon Recovery Applications', 'nylon-recovery-applications', 'Nylon recovery focuses on high-value applications: fishing nets, carpet fibers, and industrial materials. The polymer''s properties—strength, elasticity, durability—make recovery worthwhile despite processing costs.

Consumer-facing applications include recycled nylon swimwear, hosiery, and activewear. These products perform identically to virgin equivalents while reducing environmental impact.

Sourcing remains challenging—collection infrastructure for nylon waste lags behind polyester, and sorting mixed synthetic streams adds complexity.', 'published'),

-- Luxury / Couture Upcycling entries
('Haute Couture Deconstruction', 'haute-couture-deconstruction', 'Deconstructing haute couture requires reverence for original craftsmanship alongside willingness to reimagine. Vintage couture pieces often contain techniques lost to contemporary production—hand-rolled hems, bound buttonholes, couture-weight interlinings.

Practitioners document construction methods before disassembly, preserving knowledge while liberating materials. The goal is not destruction but transformation that honors original making while enabling new expression.

Resulting pieces often reference their origins: a Balenciaga-sourced jacket maintains proportions suggesting its parentage even in radically altered form.', 'published'),

('Luxury Material Reclamation', 'luxury-material-reclamation', 'Luxury materials—silk, cashmere, fine leather—justify specialized reclamation due to high replacement cost. Stained silk scarves become linings; worn cashmere sweaters yield material for accessories; damaged luxury bags provide hardware and leather for smaller items.

Quality assessment is critical: is the material worth the processing effort? Fiber degradation, moth damage, and structural weakness can render luxury materials unusable regardless of original value.

The most skilled practitioners achieve transformations where reclaimed materials outperform new equivalents, adding patina and history to inherent quality.', 'published'),

-- Cultural & Heritage Practices entries
('Traditional Textile Preservation', 'traditional-textile-preservation', 'Traditional textiles carry cultural knowledge in their construction—regional techniques, symbolic patterns, and historical production methods embedded in fabric. Preservation maintains these connections across generations.

Approaches range from museum-style conservation (stabilizing without alteration) to living preservation (continuing to use and repair traditional pieces). The latter acknowledges textiles as functional objects meant for use rather than static artifacts.

Contemporary upcyclers working with traditional textiles navigate respect for cultural significance alongside creative transformation.', 'published'),

('Regional Craft Revival', 'regional-craft-revival', 'Regional craft revival reconnects contemporary making with historical local practices. Techniques abandoned during industrialization—regional weaving patterns, local dyeing traditions, specific construction methods—find new practitioners committed to continuation.

Revival requires research, often archaeological: examining surviving examples, interpreting fragmentary documentation, and experimenting with historical materials and tools.

The resulting work grounds contemporary practice in specific places and histories, offering alternative to globalized fashion''s placelessness.', 'published'),

-- Experimental / Conceptual entries
('Speculative Material Futures', 'speculative-material-futures', 'Speculative design imagines textile futures beyond current technological constraints. What if fabrics could self-repair? What if garments could biodegrade on command? What if clothing could be grown rather than manufactured?

These speculations inform present-day research directions while challenging assumptions about material possibility. The conceptual work creates space for innovation by suggesting destinations before routes are mapped.

Even unrealizable speculations serve purpose: expanding imagination enables seeing beyond current limitations toward genuinely alternative systems.', 'published'),

('Conceptual Deconstruction Projects', 'conceptual-deconstruction-projects', 'Conceptual deconstruction uses garment disassembly as medium for commentary. The work asks questions through making: What is a garment? When does clothing become waste? How do we assign value to materials?

Projects might document complete garment decomposition, create taxonomies of component parts, or reassemble pieces according to unconventional logics.

This work operates in galleries and publications rather than commercial contexts, expanding discourse around fashion and sustainability beyond market solutions.', 'published'),

-- Educational / Research-Led entries
('Academic Upcycling Research', 'academic-upcycling-research', 'Academic research brings rigor to upcycling practice: measuring environmental impacts, developing new techniques, and documenting traditional methods. University programs in sustainable fashion produce graduates who bridge making and scholarship.

Research addresses practical questions: Which techniques achieve greatest material efficiency? How do consumers perceive upcycled products? What barriers prevent commercial scaling?

Academic work also provides historical context, connecting contemporary sustainability concerns to centuries of making-do and mending.', 'published'),

('Material Science Innovation', 'material-science-innovation', 'Material science innovation develops new processes for textile recycling and upcycling. Chemical recycling methods, fiber identification technologies, and bio-based alternatives emerge from laboratory research.
